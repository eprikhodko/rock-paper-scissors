so this is all blocks I guess.
box model, thats what it is.
so I can try to position boxes first, the way I would like them to look, and then add content.

what Im trying to achieve now, what im trying to do?
break it down, just break it all down.

I need to layout player and computer in one line.
so it become looking something like a header.
I can make it as simple as I could, and then see what happens.
