so this is all blocks I guess.
box model, thats what it is.
so just position blocks first, the way you would like them look to, and then add content.

what im trying to achieve now, what im trying to do?

I need to layout player and computer in one line.
so its some kind of a header model.
I can make it as simple as I could and see what happens.

So lets begin to work.
